# GeorgeMichaelJackson

Given a list of strings, for example artist/band names, chain the strings together such that the first and last words  of the strings overlap to form valid strings which also appear on the list. For example:

`George Michael Jackson`

is a valid overlapping concatenation of `George Michael` and `Michael Jackson`, because `Michael` is the last word of `George Michael` and the first word of `Michael Jackson`, and both appear on the input list.

The input is available at [billboard-unique.txt](src/GeorgeMichaelJackson/Assets/billboard-unique.txt)

Results are in [results.txt](results.txt).
